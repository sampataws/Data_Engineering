# # Lesson 2 Exercise 1 Solution: Creating Normalized Tables
# 
# <img src="images/postgresSQLlogo.png" width="250" height="250">

# ## In this exercise we are going to walk through the basics of modeling data in normalized form. We will create tables in PostgreSQL, insert rows of data, and do simple JOIN SQL queries to show how these mutliple tables can work together. 
# 

# #### Import the library 
# Note: An error might popup after this command has exectuted. If it does, read it carefully before ignoring.
