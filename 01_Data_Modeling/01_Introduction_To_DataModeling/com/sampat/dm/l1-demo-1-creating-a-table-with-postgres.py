# # Lesson 1 Demo 1: Creating a Table with PostgreSQL
# 
# Image title: Postgres Icon

# ## Walk through the basics of PostgreSQL:<br><li>Creating a table <li>Inserting rows of data, <li>Running a simple SQL query to validate the information. 

# ### Typically, we would use a python wrapper called *psycopg2* to run the PostgreSQL queries. This library should be preinstalled but in the future to install this library, run the following command in the notebook to install locally: 
# !pip3 install --user psycopg2
# #### More documentation can be found here: http://initd.org/psycopg/ 

# #### Import the library 
# Note: An error might popup after this command has executed. Read it carefully before proceeding.

# In[ ]:


import psycopg2


# ### Create a connection to the database
# 1. Connect to the local instance of PostgreSQL (*127.0.0.1*)
# 2. Use the database/schema from the instance. 
# 3. The connection reaches out to the database (*studentdb*) and uses the correct privileges to connect to the database (*user and password = student*).
# 
# ### Note 1: This block of code will be standard in all notebooks. 
# ### Note 2: Adding the try except will make sure errors are caught and understood

# In[ ]:


try: 
    conn = psycopg2.connect("host=127.0.0.1 dbname=studentdb user=student password=student")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Could not make connection to the Postgres database")
    print(e)


# ### Use the connection to get a cursor that can be used to execute queries.

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur = conn.cursor()
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Could not get curser to the Database")
    print(e)


# ### Use automactic commit so that each action is commited without having to call conn.commit() after each command. The ability to rollback and commit transactions is a feature of Relational Databases. 

# In[ ]:


conn.set_session(autocommit=True)


# ### Test the Connection and Error Handling Code
# The try-except block should handle the error: We are trying to do a select * on a table but the table has not been created yet.

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("select * from udacity.music_library")
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    print(e)


# ### Create a database to work in 

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("create database udacity")
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    print(e)


# ### Close our connection to the default database, reconnect to the Udacity database, and get a new cursor.

# In[ ]:


try: 
    conn.close()
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    print(e)
  
try: 
    conn = psycopg2.connect("host=127.0.0.1 dbname=studentdb user=student password=student")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Could not make connection to the Postgres database")
    print(e)
    
try: 
    cur = conn.cursor()
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Could not get curser to the Database")
    print(e)

conn.set_session(autocommit=True)


# ### We will create a Music Library of albums. Each album has a lot of information we could add to the music library table. We will  start with album name, artist name, year. 
# `Table Name: music_library
# column 1: Album Name
# column 2: Artist Name
# column 3: Year `
# ### Translate this information into a Create Table Statement. 
# 
# Review this document on PostgreSQL datatypes: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html
# 

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS music_library (album_name varchar, artist_name varchar, year int);")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Issue creating table")
    print (e)


# ### No error was found, but lets check to ensure our table was created.  `select count(*)` which should return 0 as no rows have been inserted in the table.

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("select count(*) from music_library")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Issue creating table")
    print (e)
    
print(cur.fetchall())


# ### Insert two rows 

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO music_library (album_name, artist_name, year)                  VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",                  ("Let It Be", "The Beatles", 1970))
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Inserting Rows")
    print (e)
    
try: 
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO music_library (album_name, artist_name, year)                  VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",                  ("Rubber Soul", "The Beatles", 1965))
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Inserting Rows")
    print (e)


# ### Validate your data was inserted into the table. 
# The while loop is used for printing the results. If executing queries in the Postgres shell, this would not be required.

# ### Note: If you run the insert statement code more than once, you will see duplicates of your data. PostgreSQL allows for duplicates.

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM music_library;")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: select *")
    print (e)

row = cur.fetchone()
while row:
   print(row)
   row = cur.fetchone()


# ### Drop the table to avoid duplicates and clean up

# In[ ]:


try: 
    cur.execute("DROP table music_library")
except psycopg2.Error as e: 
    print("Error: Dropping table")
    print (e)


# ###  Close the cursor and connection. 

# In[ ]:


cur.close()
conn.close()
