#Airflow Plugins
Airflow was built with the intention of allowing its users to extend and customize its functionality through plugins. The most common types of user-created plugins for Airflow are Operators and Hooks. These plugins make DAGs reusable and simpler to maintain.

To create custom operator, follow the steps:

1. Identify Operators that perform similar functions and can be consolidated
2. Define a new Operator in the plugins folder
3. Replace the original Operators with your new custom one, re-parameterize, and instantiate them.
